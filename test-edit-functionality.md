# Edit Functionality Test Plan

## Issue #7 - Multi-Booking Edit Functionality

### What Was Implemented

1. **Edit Section Navigation**: When users click "Edit" on a specific room booking in multi-booking mode, the system now:
   - Sets the active room ID to the room being edited
   - Scrolls smoothly to the appropriate section based on the edit type
   - Provides visual feedback that the user is editing that specific room

2. **Section IDs Added**:
   - `room-selection-section` - for room selection edits
   - `customization-section` - for customization edits  
   - `offers-section` - for special offers edits

3. **Updated Files**:
   - `src/components/ABS_Landing/hooks/useMultiBookingState.ts` - Implemented edit functionality
   - `src/components/ABS_Landing/sections/RoomSelectionSection.tsx` - Added section ID
   - `src/components/ABS_Landing/sections/CustomizationSection.tsx` - Added section ID
   - `src/components/ABS_Landing/sections/SpecialOffersSection.tsx` - Added section ID

### How to Test

1. **Multi-Booking Mode**: Enable multi-booking mode with multiple room bookings
2. **Edit Actions**: Click "Edit" buttons in the pricing summary for different section types
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Active room should change to the room being edited
   - Page should scroll smoothly to the appropriate section
   - User should be able to make changes for that specific room
   - Console should log the edit action for debugging

### Code Changes

#### useMultiBookingState.ts
```typescript
const handleMultiBookingEditSection = (roomId: string, sectionType: 'room' | 'customizations' | 'offers') => {
  // Set the active room for editing
  setActiveRoomId(roomId)
  
  // Scroll to the relevant section
  const sectionMap = {
    'room': 'room-selection-section',
    'customizations': 'customization-section', 
    'offers': 'offers-section'
  }
  
  const sectionId = sectionMap[sectionType]
  const sectionElement = document.getElementById(sectionId)
  
  if (sectionElement) {
    sectionElement.scrollIntoView({ 
      behavior: 'smooth', 
      block: 'start' 
    })
  }
  
  // Log for debugging
  console.log('Editing section:', sectionType, 'for room:', roomId)
}
```

#### Section Components
All main sections now have proper IDs:
- `<section id="room-selection-section">`
- `<section id="customization-section">`
- `<section id="offers-section">`
