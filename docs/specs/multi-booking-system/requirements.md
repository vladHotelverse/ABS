# Multi-Booking System - Requirements

## Business Requirements

### Primary Objective
Enable hotel guests to manage multiple room bookings through a single interface, allowing customization of each room independently while maintaining a unified booking experience.

### User Stories

#### Core User Story
**As a user that made multibooking I can choose between rooms that I have reserved and add to it room upgrade, room customization or special offer. Each changes should be added at current select room.**

#### Email-to-Booking Upsell Flow

**I want to** click the link and immediately access my multi-room booking interface  
**So that** I can customize each room independently before my arrival
