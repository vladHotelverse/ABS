# Multibooking Logical Flow - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**

### **User Story Fulfilled**
> "As user that made multibooking I can choose between rooms that I have reserved and add to it room upgrade, room customization or special offer. Each changes should be added at current select room."

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Active Room State Connection** ✅
**Problem**: Room tabs set `activeRoomId` but customization sections used `state.selectedRoom?.id`
**Solution**: 
- Created `getCurrentRoomId()` helper function that returns correct room ID based on booking mode
- Connected `activeRoomId` from multibooking state to all sections
- Ensured all changes apply to the currently selected room tab

### **2. Room-Specific Customizations** ✅
**Problem**: Customizations weren't room-aware in multibooking mode
**Solution**:
- Updated `handleCustomizationChange` to use active room ID in multibooking mode
- Modified customization section to display room-specific customizations
- Added room-specific toast messages ("Added to Deluxe Room")

### **3. Room-Specific Special Offers** ✅
**Problem**: Special offers were global, not per-room
**Solution**:
- Updated `handleBookOffer` to add/remove offers to/from active room in multibooking mode
- Modified special offers section to show room-specific selected offers
- Offers are now stored in each room's `items` array with proper metadata

### **4. Room Selection Context** ✅
**Problem**: Room selection showed all rooms instead of upgrade options
**Solution**:
- Adapted room selection for "upgrade" context in multibooking mode
- Shows currently booked room and allows upgrading to higher categories
- Updated section titles to reflect upgrade functionality
- Room upgrades are added as customizations to the active room

### **5. Visual Room Context Indicators** ✅
**Problem**: Users couldn't tell which room they were customizing
**Solution**:
- Added room context to section titles: "Customize Your Stay - Deluxe Room (Room 201)"
- Updated section subtitles to clarify room-specific actions
- Room tabs clearly show which room is active
- All toast messages include room context

### **6. Unified Item Removal Logic** ✅
**Problem**: Removing items from pricing panel wasn't room-aware
**Solution**:
- Updated `handleRemoveItem` to handle room-specific removal in multibooking mode
- Customizations and offers are removed from correct room
- Room-specific removal toast messages

### **7. PricingSummaryPanel State Synchronization** ✅
**Problem**: Selected badge and accordion state in PricingSummaryPanel wasn't synchronized with Header and BookingInfoBar room selection
**Solution**:
- Added `activeRoom` and `onActiveRoomChange` props to `MultiBookingPricingSummaryPanel`
- Updated `useAccordionState` hook to accept external control via props
- Connected PricingSummaryPanel accordion state to `activeRoomId` from `useMultiBookingState`
- PricingSummaryPanel now reflects the selected room from Header room tabs and BookingInfoBar interactions

## 📋 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Core Changes in `ABS_Landing.tsx`**

#### **1. getCurrentRoomId() Helper Function**
```typescript
const getCurrentRoomId = (): string => {
  if (shouldShowMultiBooking) {
    return activeRoomId || roomBookings[0]?.id || 'default-room'
  } else {
    return state.selectedRoom?.id || 'default-room'
  }
}
```

#### **2. Room-Aware Customization Handler**
- Uses `getCurrentRoomId()` instead of hardcoded room ID
- Adds room-specific toast messages
- Works seamlessly in both single and multibooking modes

#### **3. Room-Aware Special Offers Handler**
```typescript
if (shouldShowMultiBooking) {
  // Add/remove offers to/from active room
  // Store offers in room's items array
} else {
  // Use existing global special offers logic
}
```

#### **4. Room-Specific Data Display**
- Customizations: Show only active room's customizations
- Special Offers: Show only active room's selected offers
- Section Titles: Include active room context

#### **5. PricingSummaryPanel State Connection**
```typescript
// MultiBookingPricingSummaryPanel now receives activeRoom state
<MultiBookingPricingSummaryPanel
  activeRoom={activeRoomId}
  onActiveRoomChange={handleRoomTabClick}
  // ... other props
/>
```

#### **6. Enhanced useAccordionState Hook**
```typescript
export const useAccordionState = (
  initialRoomId?: string,
  externalActiveRoom?: string,
  onActiveRoomChange?: (roomId: string) => void
) => {
  // Uses external control if provided, otherwise internal state
  const activeRoom = externalActiveRoom !== undefined ? externalActiveRoom : internalActiveRoom
  
  const handleAccordionToggle = useCallback((roomId: string) => {
    const newActiveRoom = activeRoom === roomId ? null : roomId
    
    // Handle external control
    if (onActiveRoomChange && newActiveRoom) {
      onActiveRoomChange(newActiveRoom)
    }
  }, [activeRoom, externalActiveRoom, onActiveRoomChange])
}
```

### **Data Flow Architecture**

#### **Single Booking Mode (Unchanged)**
```
User Action → Global State → Single Pricing Panel
```

#### **Multibooking Mode (New)**
```
User Action → Active Room State → Room-Specific Items → Multi-Booking Pricing Panel
             ↓
    Room Tab Selection ←→ BookingInfoBar Selection ←→ PricingSummaryPanel Accordion
             ↓
    Synchronized Selection State (activeRoomId)
```

### **Component State Synchronization**

#### **Three-Way Synchronization:**
1. **Header Room Tabs** - User clicks room tab → Sets `activeRoomId`
2. **BookingInfoBar** - User clicks room accordion → Calls `onRoomActiveChange(roomId)`
3. **PricingSummaryPanel** - User clicks room accordion → Calls `onActiveRoomChange(roomId)`

All three components stay synchronized through the central `activeRoomId` state managed by `useMultiBookingState`.

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**
